Steps
1. create account or login to existing account
2. For full testing functionality, login with a second account in an incognito tab (to avoid negative impact of cookies)
3. Click on "create exchange" with that other user, to initiate a conversation with that user that makes use of offline messaging (the gateway to real-time chat)
4. In the offline messaging page, you can send the other user a message by typing in the message box, and then pressing submit.
5. To enter into a real-time chat between the 2 users, do the following: have one user click the link labeled "LIVE CHAT"; at the point, said user will be waiting alone in the RTC until the other user joins him, by also clicking "LIVE CHAT". 

NOTE: the only two users that are allowed into a real-time chat with a given ID X are the two users who are listed in the Exchange with that given ID X.
